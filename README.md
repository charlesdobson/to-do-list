# To-Do List
This is a simple to-do list application built in Javascript. It allows the user to input next items and check them off once completed. 

# Motivation
This is my first Javascript project and I created it to gain a better understanding of the language.

# Build Status
All basic functionality has been added. In the future, I plan to add the following features:
    * Storage capability to maintain list when browser is refreshed
    * Drop list items to bottom of list once checked as completed
